Our goal is to write a function that will receive a positive integer and return:

The phrase **"Fizz Buzz"** if the number is divisible by 3 and by 5,

The word **"Fizz"** if the number is divisible by 3,

The word **"Buzz"** if the number is divisible by 5,

**The number** as a string for all other cases.
