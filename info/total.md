We need robots to sort crystals by 3 or 5 or divisible of them number of edges.
 For this we will use ancient human word game "Fizz buzz".
You should write a function that will receive a positive integer and return:

**"Fizz Buzz"** if the number is divisible by 3 and by 5;

**"Fizz"** if the number is divisible by 3;

**"Buzz"** if the number is divisible by 5;

**The number** as a string for other cases.

**Input:** A number as an integer.
**Output:** The answer as a string.

**Example:**

```python
fizz_buzz(15) == "Fizz Buzz"
fizz_buzz(6) == "Fizz"
fizz_buzz(5) == "Buzz"
fizz_buzz(7) == "7"
```

**How it is used:**

Here you can learn how to write the simplest function and work with if-else statements.

**Precondition:**

```python
0 < number <= 1000
```
